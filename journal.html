  <h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
  <P>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</P>
  <h2>August 20, 2012</h2>

  <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Walla Walla,</li>
    <li>WA,Magic City,ID,</li>
    <li>Bountiful,UT,</li>
    <li>Last Chance,CO,</li>
    <li>Why, AZ</li>
    <li>Truth or Consequences, NM.</li>
  </ol>

  <P>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
  <blockquote>
    Passing cars,<br>
    When you can't see,<br>
    May get you,<br>
    A glimpse, <br>
    Of eternity.<br>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</P>

  <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>cell phone,</li>
   <li>iPod,</li>
   <li>digital camera,</li>
   <li>and a protein bar.</li>
  </ul> 
    <p>Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q></p>
  <p>You never know when you'll need a good quote, how about <q>To be or not to be</q>, or <q>Whereever you go, there you are</q>.</p>
